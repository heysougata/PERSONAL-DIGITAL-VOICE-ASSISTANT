other daily task help of a single voice command.

The ‘Personal Digital Voice Assistant’ developed is purely based on Python
and can be used on a device having Windows 8 and up along with a good
internet connection. So, the performance will vary with respect to the
machine and the internet connection of the device.

#  Design Constrains
  - GUI:- 
 The Graphical User Interface is based on Tkinter. The GUI is very simple to understand for the user. 
 The GUI brings one toggle button for changing the theme of the interface and three buttons each having different functions like Self Introduction(*yellow
‘INTRO’ button in Fig 2 &3 ), activation / starting the assistant(*green ‘PLAY’ button
in Fig 2&3) and exit (*red ‘Exit’ button in Fig 2&3). Overall, we tried to make an
interface which would blend in with the windows themes and would also be easy
and clean for the user to look at.
